# Firebase Studio

A modern education portal built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS** and **Firebase**.

## UI/UX Highlights

- **Design System and Theming** – central colour palette with light/dark mode toggle and updated typography.
- **Unified Navigation** – responsive sidebar with role‑based links and a mobile bottom dock.
- **Bento Dashboard Layout** – student dashboard uses a card grid for quick status overviews.
- **Protected Routes** – Next.js middleware ensures pages are restricted to authenticated roles.
- **Animated Auth Screens** – login and signup pages fade/slide into view for a polished first impression.
- **Improved Loading Experience** – full‑page blur overlay with branded spinner during route transitions.
- **Testimonial Marquee** – marketing page shows continuously scrolling success quotes.
- **Glassmorphic Tooltips** – helpful hints appear on hover for icons and actions.
- **Notification Center** – header dropdown surfaces real‑time alerts from Firebase.

These foundations make it easy to extend the portal with additional features while maintaining a cohesive experience.
